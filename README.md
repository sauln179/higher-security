# Password Generator Starter Code
For this challenge, we were to make the generatePassword function work, to create a random password.<br>
In order to do this, it would ask the user various prompts they should answer to set the criteria for the password.<br>

If none are chosen, then it will restart until one is chosen.<br>

And if at least one of these prompts is chosen, then it will ask for the length of their password, using another function<br>

An error alert will show up if the chosen length is not within acceptable parameter.<br>

Then it will generate the password, (NOTE: For some reason the object HTMLareaelement will constantly show up, even though the script is tryign to only pull the value.)<br>
